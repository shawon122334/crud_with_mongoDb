1. basic crud operation 
2. env variable 
2. create user's model , user's controller, route and save user's data in database (sign up)
3. jwt : 
        - session based : 
        - token based : when user is authenticated user gets a token and save it.
        
        - authentication : 
                          -  sign up (createUser controller)
                          -  login 
                          -> token generated for both 

                        -----------------------------------------------------------
                        -whenever new user / user object is created token should be generated
                        - to generate we use a package named jsonwebtoken (we use jwt from jsonwebtoken)
                        - we can generate token in model 
                        - for password security we use bcrypt package 


                        - create token function created in user model so that it could used many times 
                        - register user and log in user finished, token generated for both
                        -------------------------------------------------------------
        - authorization : 
                         - now user is authenticated and has token 
                         - we need two middleware (to authorize a request)
                         - we create autorize.js 
                         -
